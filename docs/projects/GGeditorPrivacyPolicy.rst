Privacy Policy of GGeditor
**************************

The GGeditor is an Google Docs Addon, it is developped and running in the sandbox with the script API of the Google Docs System. Within the sandbox, it accesses, use users documents and stores users settings.  

The GGeditor's major feature is to convert a Google document into reStructured text and exports them to user owned Github repository. Besides that it does not share any content to any parities nor the GGeditor author.  It did the conversion and exporting by user's request only.

As an add-on of the Google Docs, the GGeditor does nothing without user's interaction. The GGeditor does not collect any Google users data for its own sake, neither no Google Analytics to watch users behavior (I am not saying that Google didn't do it when user activates the GGeditor to do reST conversion, actually I have no idea whether they do it or not, just saying that the GGeditor didn't do it). Besides exporting to user's Github repository by user's request, all the other dataflow are inbetween user's browser and the Google Docs System. The GGeditor author does not setup any 3-rd party facilities to participate during the whole usage cycle.
