Privacy Policy of GGeditor
**************************

version 2021/10/15

This document would thoroughly disclose the manner in which the GGeditor accesses, uses, stores, or shares Google user data. The "Google user data" means to the opening Google document which Add-ons of the Google Docs are working.

\ |STYLE0|\ 

The GGeditor is an Add-on for the Google Docs App.  When users installed The GGeditor add-on. It is listed on the menu bar by the Google Docs Aoo. The GGeditor works in an environment which is provided and limited by the Add-on feature of the Google Docs. The GGeditor accesses the opening Google document via the Google Docs App.

\ |STYLE1|\ 

The GGeditor convert content of the opening Google document to reStructuredText format.

\ |STYLE2|\ 

The GGeditor does not store any content of the opening Google document. The GGeditor only stores users settings via the Google Docs App. Which is provided by the Add-on development API.

\ |STYLE3|\ 

The GGeditor does not share content of the opening Google document. 

The converted reStructuredText content would be pushed to a repository of the Github. That repository is owned by the user,  not the GGeditor. Because the repository name, path and credentials for accessing that repository are all given by the user.

\ |STYLE4|\ 

The GGeditor is an Google Docs Addon, it is developped and running within the sandbox of the Google Docs System. Within the sandbox, it accesses, inserts content into user's document and stores user's settings.  

The GGeditor's major feature is to convert a Google Doc document into text of reStructured format, then exports the text content to the Github repository owned by the same user. It does not share any content to any parities nor the GGeditor author.  The conversion and exporting to the Github is all under user's manual operation.

As an Add-on of the Google Docs, the GGeditor does anything by user's interaction. There is no automation in background. The GGeditor does not collect any Google users' data, neither no Google Analytics to watch usage behavior (I am not saying that Google does not do it when a user activates the GGeditor Add-on, actually I have no idea whether they do it or not, I am just saying that the GGeditor does not collect any data for watching usage behavior).
