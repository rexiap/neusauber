“Steel begins to corrode the day it is cast” Matthew R. Simmons, founder of the internationally renowned Energy Foundation.

The conventional theory of rustproof requires that the rust is removed totally, but also requires the use of very thick coating to avoid metal corrosion caused by external factors. However, the practice of the rust removal method is one of the main causes of rapid corrosion, for example, water jet or sand blasting. Cause by the water jet  cannot reach the point of view, the actual rust removal rate average attend to 90% only, there are up to 10% of rust wrapped into the coating, and the rust cause by water calculated in not yet.

Sand blasting, although it can reach a very high rate of rust removal. However, in high humidity environment, the surface will generate a large number of rust spots, if not in half an hour to one hour paint protection, practically hardly reached. Moreover, there are many cases in which any rust removal method can not be used.

We are developed of rust-freeze technology, take the initiative to freeze the rust activity, the corrosion reaction to stop the series of "AR transparent rust inhibitor," so as to improve or complement the current anti-rust blind spot and the implementation of the practical to achieve rustproof design life.

AR transparent rust inhibitor series - rust removal not required, instead of lead, zinc primer to improve the original anti-rust life by 3 times.

All AR transparent rust inhibitors are RoHS compliant, VOCs free, FDA suitable.

Model: AR transparent rust inhibitor

Function: Rust-Freeze, Anti-rust

Features:

  1. Rust activeties no longer corrodes the metal, will not swell blisters.

  2. Exempts the rust removal.

  3. Completes the work after the coating is finished, the protection takes effect after 30 minutes.

  4. Transparent film does not change the appearance.

  5. Variety of metals can be applied.

  6. To prevent humidity with salt, sulfur, acid gas erosion.

  7. To improve the surface treatment or rustproof ability of the original 3 times.

  8. Newly, or rusty surface can be used.

Model: ARPrimer transparent rust inhibitor

Function: Rust-Freeze, adhesion improver

Features:

  1. Rust activeties no longer corrodes the metal, will not swell blisters.

  2. Exempts the rust removal.

  3. Curing free, treating paint directly after coated ARPrimer.

  4. Increase the anti-rust paint life 3 times.

  5. Replace the common primer, lead primer, zinc primer.

  6. Improve the adhesion of hot-dip galvanized surface paint.

  7. To reach the original design rust life of the paint.
